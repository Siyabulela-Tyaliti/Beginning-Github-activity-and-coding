# Python Learning Log 🐍📚

This repository documents my learning journey through the IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate on Coursera. I'm a recent mathematics graduate exploring the world of data engineering — and I'm discovering deep connections between the logic of math and the structure of Python.

## 🔍 Key Insights & Epiphanies

### 🌀 Loops & Modular Arithmetic
While learning about the `range()` function in Python loops, I realized it mirrors **Modular Arithmetic** concepts from Abstract Algebra. Just like how modular systems “wrap around” values, `range(start, stop, step)` steps through integers in a predictable pattern. It reminded me of clock arithmetic and the importance of stepping through sets with structure.

### 📇 Dictionaries & `enumerate()`
The `enumerate()` function returns index-item pairs from a list. This reminded me of **Python dictionaries**, which store key-value pairs. I connected that:
- An index in `enumerate()` is like a key
- Dictionaries generalize this idea by allowing non-integer keys
- You can use `enumerate(dict.values())` to mimic index-value pairing

### 🚨 Exception Handling & Error Messages
While watching a video on exception handling, I had an epiphany: **error messages are real-time applications of exception handling!** When something goes wrong (like dividing by zero), Python doesn’t crash randomly — it uses a system to raise exceptions and give meaningful messages. That hit me with a wave of excitement and understanding.
